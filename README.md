plugin_job_market - aka Graduate Student add-on
=================
**Current Version: ** 2.0

This adds the metabox and widget for graduate students/job market candidates.  Originally built specifically for the Department of Economics. The people plugin must also be activated.  Will need to modify the widget text each academic year.

Also can use this plugin and metafields for an expanded graduate student directory. See Philosophy and History departments for examples.
